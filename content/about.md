## Hello there!

My name is Cervando Ba√±uelos II and I am a Texas farmboy that grew up in a goat farm, has a nuclear engineering degree, a master's in nonproliferation and terrorism studies, a master's in computer science, and I regularly take things apart only to realize I ended up with more parts than what I started with. 

I am an avid lover lunch time, my corgi, and all things offensive security related. So much that some friends and I have started our own cybersecurity conference named after my corgi Freckles!

At the end of the day, all views represented here are my own, and the things I write about may seem trivial to some, perplexing to others, and downright idiotic to most. I write about things ranging from cybersecurity to nuclear reactors, or whatever dumb project I am working on. Come with me for the ride and let's learn!
